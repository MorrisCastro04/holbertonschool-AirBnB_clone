Inline styling: Create an HTML page with a header and a footer using inline styling for all tags. The layout includes a header with a red background and a footer with a green background. The text "Holberton School" should be centered vertically and horizontally in the footer.
Head styling: Similar to the first task, but this time, use the style tag in the head tag instead of inline styling. The layout remains the same.
CSS files: Create an HTML page with a header and a footer using separate CSS files for styling. Three CSS files are required: one for global styles (body), one for header styling, and one for footer styling.
Zoning done!: Expand on the previous tasks by adding more styling details. Create a header with a white background and a border at the bottom. The footer should also have a white background and a border at the top. The text "Holberton School" in the footer should be centered vertically and horizontally.
Search!: Add a filters box with a search button between the header and footer. The filters box should have a white background, a border, and contain a button with the text "Search". Apply specific styling rules to achieve the desired layout.
More filters: Enhance the filters box by adding locations and amenities filters. Display them as divs with titles and subtitles. Apply appropriate styling to achieve the layout specified in the task.
It's (h)over: Implement a contextual dropdown for the locations and amenities filters. When the mouse hovers over each filter, display a dropdown list with fake text. Apply CSS to style the dropdowns accordingly.
Display results: Finally, add a section to display search results. Each result should include information such as price, number of guests, bedrooms, bathrooms, owner details, and a description. Apply CSS to style the results section and the individual result articles.
Throughout the project, you'll learn and practice HTML and CSS concepts such as structuring a webpage, applying styles, using different tags, and organizing CSS code into separate files. The project emphasizes creating a visually appealing and user-friendly front-end for the AirBnB clone without the use of JavaScript or dynamic data loading.
